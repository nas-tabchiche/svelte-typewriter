# svelte-typewriter
> A simple and reusable typewriter effect for your Svelte applications

[![PRs Welcome](https://img.shields.io/badge/PRs-welcome-brightgreen.svg)](http://makeapullrequest.com)

[DEMO](https://svelte.dev/repl/9dfb73bfa9b34aeea4740fa23f5cde8a?version=3.14.1)

> **NOTICE:** In order to keep delivering new features in short periods, and keeping up the development of
> `svelte-typewriter` seamlessy and without bloating the codebase with unnecessary features and bottlenecks, the
> support for animating elements with the `use:typewriter` directive will be dropped starting from version `2.0` due
> to it's implementation flaws in comparison to it's component-based counterpart whom is way more readable and easier > to maintain of the, thanks for you comprehension!

> If you want to keep using the old directive-based approach, install the old version by running: `npm i -D svelte-typewriter@1.5.5`

## Installation

```bash
# yarn
yarn add -D svelte-typewriter

# npm
npm install -D svelte-typewriter
```

## Usage

You can apply the typewriter effect on your elements in two ways:

- Component-based approach
- Directive-based approach *(pre-2.0 only)*

### Component-based approach

In order to use this method, you need to import the Svelte component, and wrap your elements with the `<Typewriter>` component

```svelte
<script>
	import Typewriter from 'svelte-typewriter'
</script>

<Typewriter>
	<h1>Testing the typewriter effect</h1>
	<h2>The typewriter effect cascades by default</h2>
	<p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur</p>
</Typewriter>
```

### Directive-based approach

> **WARNING:** this option is deprecated, and will only work on versions under 2.0

This method relies on [Svelte actions](https://svelte.dev/docs#use_action) (more specifically, the `use:action` directive), in order to animate your components with this approach, you must import the directive and include it as a attribute on your element

```svelte
<script>
	import typewriter from 'svelte-typewriter/typewriter'
</script>

<!-- Without parameters -->
<h1 use:typewriter>Hello World!</h1>

<!-- With parameters -->
<h1 use:typewriter={{ loop: true, interval: 50 }}>The force will be with you, Always...</h1>
```

## Options

You can control the behavior of the typewriter effect by passing specific props to the `Typewriter` component

### `interval`

The interval in milliseconds between each letter

default: `30`

[DEMO](https://svelte.dev/repl/eb6caec159cf454b8f2bc98f3444fa8c?version=3.14.1)

#### Example:

```svelte
<Typewriter interval={50}>
	<p>Each letter of this paragraph will be displayed with a interval of 50 milliseconds</p>
</Typewriter>
```

You can also pass a custom array of distinct intervals to mimic human typing

```svelte
<Typewriter interval={[50, 60, 80]}>
	<p>Each letter of this paragraph will be randomly displayed with an interval of 50 or 60 or 80 milliseconds</p>
</Typewriter>
```

### `cascade`

Enables the cascading mode, where each element is animated sequentially instead of simultaneously

default: `false`

[DEMO](https://svelte.dev/repl/9ddb89942e954a2a90b553356952ff46?version=3.14.1)

#### Example:

```svelte
<Typewriter cascade>
	<h1>First</h1>
	<h2>Second</h2>
	<h3>Third</h3>
</Typewriter>
```

### `loop`

Cycles the typewriter animation between the children elements of the `<Typewriter>` component

> **Warning:** won't work if `cascade` is enabled

> When using the `loop` prop, the tag name will be determined by the first child of the `<Typewriter>` component

default: `false`

#### Example:

```svelte
<Typewriter loop>
	<p>This is a draft about the loop typewriter effect</p>
	<p>This is a draft about svelte-typewriter</p>
	<p>This text has nothing to do with the two previous phrases</p>
</Typewriter>
```

You can also pass a custom time interval between loops in milliseconds (the default interval is 1500 milliseconds)

```svelte
<Typewriter loop={500}>
	<p>This is a draft about the loop typewriter effect</p>
	<p>This is a draft about svelte-typewriter</p>
	<p>This text has nothing to do with the two previous phrases</p>
</Typewriter>
```


### `cursor`

> **INFO:** requires version ^2.0

Enables/disables the terminal cursor on the Typewriter animation, and also, allows you to pass any valid color name, hex code, rgb/rgba valid values to change the cursor color

```svelte
<Typewriter>
	<p>Terminal vibes, now on the web!</p>
</Typewriter>

<!-- Disables the cursor -->
<Typewriter cursor={false}>
	<p>No cursor here :/</p>
</Typewriter>

<!-- Changes the cursor color to green -->
<Typewriter cursor='green'>
	<p>All things green</p>
</Typewriter>
```

default: `true`
